    },
    "embed": {
      "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "title": { "type": "string", "description": "the header for the embedded content. For example, the title of a song. (optional)" },
         "thumbnail": { "type": "string", "description": "a URL to a valid image to display alongside the content (optional)." },
         "description": { "type": "string", "description": "a short description of the content." },
         "footer": { "type": "string", "description": "small, short text to append after the rest of the content, for example 'powered by Scrubby', 'from spotify' (optional)" }
         "fields": {
           "type": "array",
           "description": "any tabular data from the output; for example, artist name, song name, album name (optional).",
           "items": {
             "type": "array",
             "prefixItems": [
               { "type": "string", "description": "the label for this field (e.g. 'Artist')" },
               { "type": "string", "description": "the value of this field (e.g. '(name of song)')" },
               { "type": "boolean", "description": "true if the value for this field is long and should be displayed full width." },
             ]
